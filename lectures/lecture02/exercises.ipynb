    "## Practice exercises\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You can work through these exercises during the lecture, in the afternoon GTA supported session, or in your own time. Example answers are available [here](./answers.ipynb). Note that the answers given have mostly been written for clarity, rather than necessarily being the most efficient, compact or perfect code.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "If your time is short, then concentrate on exercises 1, 2, 5 and 7. You may also find the sandpile exercise at the end of the notebook useful preparation for this week's assessment exercise.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Exercise One: Running Python Code\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Run the following commands \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python \r\n",
    "def square_and_cube(n):\r\n",
    "    return sorted([i**2 for i in range(n)]+[i**3 for i in range(n)])\r\n",
    "print(square_and_cube(3))\r\n",
    "print(square_and_cube(10))\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "and \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "import numpy as np\r\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n",
    "x = np.linspace(0, 6*np.pi)\r\n",
    "plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "    \r\n",
    "in a notebook, in a vanilla Python interpreter and in a QtConsole/IPython console/terminal. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    " - In each case, try modifying the `square_and_cube` function to also include the 4th power of n.\r\n",
    " - The `sorted` function returns a new sorted list from an iterable. Try accessing the Python online help in the ordinary interpreter to invert the order of the list. Note you'll need to use the `help` function, since the `sorted?` syntax is in IPython/Jupyter only.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "_Tip_: for the IPython console, you may find the [ipython magic](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) command `%paste` useful.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Exercise Two: Find the primes\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Using VS Code (or your own prefered data entry method), write a Python *script* (i.e. a .py file) to output the first 20 prime numbers and run it from a command line. If you answered lecture 2 in the introductory exercises, you can start from the code you wrote there, or otherwise, start from fresh.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Tips:\r\n",
    "- One way of doing this uses an outer loop counting how many primes you have, and then code to find the next prime number.\r\n",
    "- Note that a number cannot be prime if it divides by a prime number and that 1 is not prime. \r\n",
    "-  If a number is not prime, it must have at least one factor smaller than its own square root. This can be used to improve the efficiency of your search.\r\n",
    "- If `a` divides `b` exactly, then `a%b==0`, which gives a quick test using the modulus operator `%`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "When testing your code, you should expect the output for the first 5 primes to be `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11]`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Try to convert the script into a routine to calculate all prime numbers smaller than an input number, $n$ using `sys.argv`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "A [model solution](https://msc-acse.github.io/ACSE-1/lectures/lecture7-solutions.html#exercise1) for the script is available.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Exercise Three: Find the mean\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Write a script file (i.e. a .py file) to calculate the mean of a sequence of numbers. As an extension, tru make it take extra options (using the `argparse` module) `-b`, `-o` and `-x` to work with with binary (i.e. base 2, with `101 == 5` in decimal) , octal (i.e. base 8, with `31 == 25` decimal)  and hexadecimal (i.e. base 16 `2A == 42` decimal) numbers.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Test your basic script on the following sequences: `1` (mean 1) `1 5 7 13 8` (mean 6.8), `2.5, 4 ,-3.2, 9.3` (mean 3.15).</p>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Also try feeding it no input.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "_Tips_:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<p>For the longer version you can use the 2 argument version of the <code>int</code> function to change the base of numbers. For example <code>int('11',2)==3</code> and <code>int('3A', 16)==58</code>.</p>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Model answers are provided for the [short](https://msc-acse.github.io/ACSE-1/lectures/lecture7-solutions.html#exercise2) exercise and for the [long](https://msc-acse.github.io/ACSE-1/lectures/lecture7-solutions.html#exercise3) version which takes options flags.\r\n",

    "### Exercise Four: Plots in scripts\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Write a script to plot the functions $y=\\sin(x)$, $y=\\cos(x)$ and $y=\\tan(x)$ to screen over the range [0,$2\\pi$] and then run it in a terminal/prompt.\r\n",

    "## Exercise: The Abelian Sandpile\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "A sandpile model is a cellular automaton consisting of a 2d lattice of values, $h_{i,j} \\in [0, 1, 2 \\ldots]$ (i.e positve integers), with the guarantee that $\\sum h_{i,j}<\\infty$. These may be thought of as the heights of piles of sand, which may eventually topple, passing on sand particles to other cells. A given initial configuration specifies the number of grains dropped in each cell, which evolve over time based on the rules of the model towards a final steady state.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### The rules\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Any cell with $h_{i,j}\\ge 4$ will eventually topple, sending particles out to its neighbouring cells\r\n",

    "$$h_{i,j-1}\\rightarrow h_{i,j-1}+1$$\r\n",
    "where the states of the cell and its neighbours immediately post topple only depend on the values before and the fact that the topple occured. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "With \"sink\" boundaries that simply absorb particles and never release them, these topplings will continue until every cell is of height 3 or below. It turns out that this end state is independent of the order in which the cells topple, so that there is a unique mapping from initial to final, stable configuration (hence the use of the term Abelian, which implies that the order of topplings commute). In particular, this means the same outcome is achieved whether only one toppling, or many, are assumed to occur each iteration.\r\n",
