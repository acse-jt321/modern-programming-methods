    "## Introducing the Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the cloud?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Azure.png](attachment:Azure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple related definitions, e.g. Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet. Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> _from the cloud computing article_\n",
    "\n",
    "or from Microsoft:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services – including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and intelligence – over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale. Typically, you only pay for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, \"the Cloud\" is a set of networked computer resources accessed remotely over a wide area network such as the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Cloud vs. Private Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Public Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Public Cloud, _services_ are bought (often Pay As You Go) on a need basis, with infrastructure shared with other users (often on a per machine basis)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple providers:\n",
    "    - Microsoft Azure\n",
    "    - Amazon AWS\n",
    "    - Google Cloud Services\n",
    "    - Alibaba Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Private Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "For a Private Cloud system, the full _infrastructure_ (i.e. computer equipment at the data centre level) is purchased, and then run (or subcontracted) by the company or organization in question, and then accessed over a network (the network itself may be public, so via the internet, or private). This gives full control over hardware, policy and configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example, the college [HPC clusters](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/support/getting-started/) (aka CX1 &CX2) provide multi-machine compute systems to Imperial researchers, based out of a data centre in Slough, to the west of London.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hybrid Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "In a hybrid cloud situation an organization run a private cloud on their own data centre, but purchases additional public cloud services as needed. In principle, this allows the organization to combine the control and intellectual property advantages of private cloud with the availability and scalability advantages of the public cloud. In practice this can sometimes lead to duplication of effort, or attempts to replicate unsuitable policies from the private cloud service into the public cloud part.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why use the cloud?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Availability - systems tend to be online and supported 24/7 (and not by you)\n",
    "- Scalability - Increasing/decreasing your allocation tends to happen instantly (or as soon as your credit card bill allows)\n",
    "- Reach - Systems are accessible from most of the world via the Internet\n",
    "- Agility - rapidly develop, test & deploy software\n",
    "- Disaster Mitigation - Usually offer backups/rollbacks, sometimes at extra cost. Note that this doesn't prevent users needing to check that what's backed up is what was intended.\n",
    "- Fault Tolerance - Cloud systems usually fallback to alternatives in case of physical failures.\n",
    "- Elasticity - Systems can react dynamically to increasing or decreasing demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why not to use the cloud?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Latency issues - Keep large bandwidth data transfers local to each other.\n",
    "- Costs (Data transfer, machine hire, etc.)\n",
    "- Security - You are handing your data to someone else.\n",
    "- Control - If you need personal oversight.\n",
    "- Intellectual property concerns - some data may have legal or contractual constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Infrastructure, Platform and Software as a Service\n",
    "\n",
    "\"As a service\" can be treated the same as \"available to rent\". Just as the difference between renting a hire car versus hailing a taxi, the different levels of service imply different levels of responsibility and control. We can list the three most typical types here. Note that precisely where in this hierarchy a specific service can be difficult, particularly when services are parcelled up and resold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Infrastructure As A Service is the most basic model for using the Cloud. You purchase time on an entire computer (usually actually a virtual machine, i.e. a portion of a large server), then set up the entire system from scratch, just as you would with a computer under your desk.\n",
    "\n",
    "IASS gives you maximum control of your environment (you can do virtually anything you like within the constraints of your cloud provider's security policies). However this also means you have considerable responsibilities (applying updates, scaling machine sizes, etc), and may be paying more than you would for other models, particularly if you have severely overestimated your system requirements *or leave machines running but unused*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Platform As A Service (PaaS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Platform as a service further abstracts away the concepts of hardware and environment so that you can concentrate on writing the code which actually does the job that you want to do. The provider configures the core operating system and programming environment, with you just writing the actual application code. An example would be a service such as www.mybinder.org or Google Colab, which provides Jupyter instances to work in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software As A Service (SaaS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Software As A Service is the cloud model with the lowest barrier to entry. The provider supplies both the infrastructure and the application software, allowing you to concentrate purely on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Coffee model \n",
    "\n",
    "We can illustrate the differences by considering an alternative industry, that of coffee:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coffee as a service\n",
    "\n",
    "Who is in charge of doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "||On premises (caffetiere)|IaaS (Drip machine)|PaaS (Nespresso)|SaaS (cafe)|\n",
    "|-|:---:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n",

    "|Grind|You|You|Them|Them|\n",
    "|Pour|You|Them|Them|Them|\n",

    "The same table for cloud computing looks somewhat like:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Accessing Azure Cloud Services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting an Azure account\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft Azure provides a number of different kinds of accounts and subscription methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Free accounts \n",
    "- Promotional subscriptions\n",
    "- Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions\n",
    "- Enterprise subscriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Most relevant for this course is the Azure Student subscription, which allows users from authorized educational institutions (such as Imperial College) to register each year for $100 of free credit and (slightly limited) access to all Azure services. Activation is via your college email address, to which your account will be linked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) is the (desktop) point of interaction with Azure services on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logging into the Portal\n",
    "\n",
    "You automatically have access to the Azure portal via your college login id (in the form `abc120@ic.ac.uk`) and password. In fact, Imperial College delegate their system authentication to Azure Active Directory, a Microsoft Azure Cloud service for authentication and authorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once logged in you can sign up for your student subscription on this [page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/overview) using the \"claim your Azure credit now\" button. This will give you 100 US dollars  of (virtual) money to spend on Microsoft Cloud services. Watch out! While 100 dollars can last a very long time if used carefully, it can rapidly run out if you leave expensive services running. Always be sure to shut down virtual machines that you are no longer using, and to clean up after yourself."

    "## Web protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### TCP/IP \n",
    "\n",
    "Computers on a public network use numbers (called \"IP addresses\") to find each other. The most famous form, \"ipv4\" uses 32bit numbers, normally written divided into 4 bytes (i.e 4 numbers 0-255) separated by a period, eg. 146.179.40.148 (this is the IP address of an Imperial computer). These numbers divide into subnetworks. In general the leftmost numbers indicate the largest sub-networks, and the rightmost the smallest and usually most local. If this were a physical address, the leftmost part might be a country name, the middle part a city and street, and the right most a house or flat number.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory a 32 bit number allows for 4,294,967,296 different addresses, but these public addresses have been allocated in an uneven way and some are reserved for specific purposes (e.g. to be used to indicate a private network). As such the newer \"ipv6\" standard uses 128bit numbers, usually written as eight four character hexadecimal numbers, separated by \":\" characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP/HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "Once computers can identify each other, they need to communicate. On the web the most visible protocol for this is probably the hyptertext transfer protocol, or HTTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP & HTTPS (i.e HTTP served via a secure TLS layer) addresses will be familiar to you from your experience on the web. They are an example of a uniform resource locator (URL) or uniform resource indicator (URI), which in this case takes the form\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://user:password@www.imperial.ac.uk:8000/example/example/example.html?val1=abc&val2=123.4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This web address can be broken down into several sections\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The leftmost part defines the protocol (think of it as an agreed language) being used. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "When using HTTPS an encryption method must be agreed between the user agent (e.g. the browser) and the server. The standard pattern is that the server will hand over a \"certificate\", i.e. a message containing a cryptographic key to be used to encrypt a message to it. This cerificate will be \"signed\" by a trusted third party, where the signature is another message which (via encryption) can only have been generated by that third party. Using the key from the certificate the browser generates a new temporary key which both sides will use for this communication session and sends it back to the server. Once the process is complete all a snooper in the middle should be able to see is that a conversation is happening between the two IPs.\n",
    "   \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not frequently used with HTTP (due to relative lack of security in the service) but usernames (and even passwords) can be provided inside the URL. Some of you will have seen this given as an instruction when using HTTPS with GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Server\n",
    "\n",
    "The server provides a human readable mnemonic for the IP address of the remote server being connected to. This is looked up, working from right to left by contacting helper \"name servers\" (aka DNS servers) to find the machine you request. So in this case, a global server will be contacted to find a `.uk` DNS server, which points us at the `.imperial` server, which points us at the internal Imperial webserver (or at least a gateway computer) dealing with requests to `www`, which could be the 146.179.40.148 address given above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Port number\n",
    "\n",
    "Ports can be thought of as individual communication addresses on a single machine. Only one type of communication can happen on one port at a one time, although multiple users can be served. Some protocols have standard ports which they default to if no specific port number is given, e.g. port 80 for plain HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS, port 22 for ssh, and so on. See e.g. [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers) on Wikipedia for more examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### path (sometimes called \"endpoint\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The portion from the end of the server name to the beginning of the parameters is passed to the remote application connected to the port to decide what response to give. For a simple static http server this might be a directory path to a specific file. For a dynamic server, this might be a more complicated incantation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warn\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "The word endpoint is used repeatedly with reference to web APIs, and not always consistently.\n",
    "    \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The text beyond the `?` consists of a set of parameters, encoded in a `key=value` format, which is again passed on to the server application to use when generating its output.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### HTTP Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "When connected, the client user agent will send messages (called \"requests\") to the server, which will reply with messages of its own (called \"responses\"). The actual content of a basic HTTP request is something like the following\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GET /test?message HTTP/1.1 request body\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we specify the HTTP method (a verb telling the server what we want to do), the path and query parameters (together) the protocol version, and any additional data the request is passing (this might be text, (e.g. JSON data, or the results of a form, or it might be binary data, such as a file we want to upload."

    "#### HTTP Methods\n",
