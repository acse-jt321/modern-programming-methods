    "# The Cloud, Part II: Virtualization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Front Matter\n",
    "### October 21st 2021 - Version 2.1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contact Details\n",

    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the basic difference between an emulator, a virtual machine and a container\n",
    "- Know how to provision your own virtual machines on Azure\n",
    "- Know the basics of building your own Docker container\n",
    "- Understand the basics using SQL in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtualization & Containerization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compatibility layers/Emulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before considering full virtualization, there are compatibility layers (such as the Windows Subsystem for Linux version 1, WSL1, which allows linux problems to run on windows, or WINE, which does the reverse). Very similar are the various translation layers released for Mac OS X during hardware transitions, from powerPC to Intel chips and from 32 to 64 bit software. It is likely that similar software exists as Apple transition from Intel to ARM/Nvidia chips in their latest range.\n",
    "\n",
    " These software layers act at the level of application, which allows software created for one operating system to run on another operating system by translating commands intended for one interface into commands intended for another. Very similar is emulation, in which software is created to play the part of hardware not physically present in the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Virtual Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Servers in data centres are often designed to maximize the number of processor cores available on every motherboard, with multiple CPU sockets and high core counts on the individual dies. However the number of cores users actually need varies, often as low as 1 core for simple, low priority serial tasks. Virtualization allows Cloud providers to portion out the cores of a particular server board between multiple users, with each of them experiencing behaviour as if they had access to an entire machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, virtualization is fairly simple: Computer software has developed in layers, which communicate with each other via standard interfaces. This allows equipment from multiple manufacturers to work together. In a physical computer the hardware & firmware (e.g. the BIOS) sit below the operating system. In a virtual machine a second operating system sits above a software layer running on the host operating which provides an interface to some of the underlying hardware, typically only a subset of the real hardware available to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### A Concrete example: Buying time on an Azure Virtual Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure provides virtual machine images in Windows and linux. The first exercise talks through setting up your own linux VM via the portal GUI. In short, the instructions are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)\n",
    "2. From the **All services** blade search for and select **Virtual machines** and then click **+ Add** and chose **+ Virtual machine**\n",
    "3. Set up the machine with appropriate settings in terms of base image and access protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that while the machine is running, it will burn through your subscription credit, so always shut down and delete VMs you no longer want.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Azure Web services & Web Apps\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key questions with cloud services is which protocol to use to access them. For Azure services their are three major options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), to access Windows (and some linux) virtual machines and to use them in the same manner as a desktop.\n",
    "- Secure Shell (SSH), to access a terminal on VMs (or apps on linux through X forwarding)\n",
    "- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) to access services via the web, whether through a browser, or another application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look further how that can work:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### RDP\n",
    "\n",
    "The remote desktop protocol (RDP) allows you to connect to a remote Windows machine via a network and use it as if it were on your desk. Client is avaialble on Windows, Mac & linux, as well as on Android and iOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### SSH\n",
    "\n",
    "[SSH](https://v4.software-carpentry.org/shell/ssh.html), the secure shell provides a cryptographically secured shell (i.e. prompt, terminal or command line interface) connection from one computer to another via a network. It supports login via username & password, or via the exchange of cryptographic keys (that is, via [public key cryptography](). Implementations, both of the server and the client, are available on Windows, linux and Mac OS X.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "Public key cryptography is based on the idea that some mathematical operations are hard to \"undo\" without secret information. Perhaps the most famous alorithm, [RSA]() uses results from prime numbers, namely that given two large prime numbers, $p$ and $q$ then if\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e\\cdot d = 1 \\mod (p-1)(q-1) $$ \n",
    "with $e$ and $(p-1)(q-1)$ coprime it's true that\n",
    "$$ m^{ed} = m \\mod pq $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if I *pick* $e$ and work out a suitable $d$, I can keep $d$ secret (my private key), but send you $e$ and $n=pq$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now **you** can send **me** a message $m$ by calculating\n",
    "$$c = m^e \\mod n $$\n",
    "which I read by calculating\n",
    "$$ c^d \\mod n = m^{de}\\mod n = m \\mod n.$$\n",
    "Similarly I can send you a message which you know comes from me\n",
    "by calculating\n",
    "$$c = m^d \\mod n $$\n",
    "which you read by calculating\n",
    "$$ c^e \\mod n = m^{de}\\mod n = m \\mod n.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as we know, the only way of breaking this code is to factorise $n = p*q$, which gets expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a command in the form `ssh <user>@<server name>`, e.g. `ssh jrper@sshgw.ic.ac.uk` one can open a connection to a remote machine using the default port number (22).\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP/HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "By now you are probably sick of hearing about HTTP, so I won't say any more here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Azure App Services to serve apps\n",
    "\n",
    "[Azure Web Apps Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/app-service/web/) delivers http based (especially Flask based) Apps direct from GitHub. We'll do a live demonstration of putting an app on the web from Flask code we put on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers represent a lightweight form of virtualization, where a system runs one operating system kernel, but potentially with many userspaces and filesystems (run from file images on the host system) on top of them. By virtualizing at such a high level tens or hundreds of containers can run simultaneously on the same machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "The most famous and widely used container system is [Docker](https://docker.com). The most used version of this tool uses the Linux kernel to produce a (somewhat) sandboxed userspace connected to its own filesystem. In Docker terminology, scripts called Dockerfiles are used to configure bundles called \"images\" containing a frozen system which can be copied and unfrozen as a container, including a default executable to run. A simple example Dockerfile might look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "_Dockerfile_\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# set base image to build on\n",
    "FROM python:3.8\n",
    "\n",
    "# set/create current working directory inside container\n",
    "WORKDIR /example\n",
    "\n",
    "# copy a file from the host to the container\n",
    "COPY requirements.txt .\n",
    "\n",
    "# run a shell command\n",
    "RUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "# default command to run when container starts\n",
    "ENTRYPOINT python \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As with Bash shell commands `#` is used to start a comment in Docker and is not interpreted when building an image. The genuine commands start with an instruction to Docker (written in capital letters  here), followed by arguments to that instruction. The full list of possible commands is available [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/), along with a smaller cheat sheet [here](https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/d8/2019-09/docker-cheat-sheet.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a short summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Command| Example | Usage |\n",
    "|:-----:|:-------:|:-----:|\n",
    "|FROM | `FROM python:3.8`| Specify base image to start from.|\n",
    "| COPY | `COPY file.txt /home` | Copy a local file to the container image.|\n",
    "| ADD  | `ADD https://example.com/test.zip .` | Copy local or remote file to container image. |\n",
    "| WORKDIR | `WORKDIR /home/user` | Switch to/create directory in container.|\n",
    "| RUN     | `RUN python myfile.py`   | Execute command in container image. |\n",
    "| CMD     | `CMD echo \"hello\"       | set default command for `docker run` on image.|\n",
    "| ENTRYPOINT | `ENTRYPOINT echo` | set default command for `docker run` on image (accepts command line arguments). |\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Dockerfile given above, we can tell amachine with Docker running to build the instructions in the Dockerfile into a container image using a command with the syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker build [OPTIONS] PATH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "inside the directory containing the Dockerfile and `requirements.txt` file. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker build --tag example .\n",
    "```\n",
    "Docker then processes the file line by line into an image, storing each stage as an intermediate checkpoint. When the image is complete it can be run as a container using a command of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The deafult command is set with the CMD or ENTRYPOINT instruction. So to run our Python example interactively connected through the terminal we run\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -it example\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give you access to the python interpreter _inside_ the container, with only system libraries and the packages from the `requirements.txt` available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker container images can be uploaded and downloaded to a site called [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/), which acts as a repository for them in the same way GitHub does for code. This allows docker images to be shared easily. If you attempt to run an image that is not available as a tag name on your computer, docker will try to download it from dockerhub.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that this code is written to work locally in a terminal. If you are attempting to run it in a Jupyter session then:\n",
    "1. The session will have to be running on a local system or one which you connect to via a windowing system (e.g. RDP, or with a suitable SSH connection with X forwarding).\n",

One protection against this is to use [firewalls]() to limit access to systems to come from from [IP addresses]() from which requests are accepted.\n",

On the other hand, as a technically trained person it's possible that it's something you will one day be asked to organize (or manage). Current best practice is at or above the following protocols:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use HTTPS for your initial communication.\n",
    "2. When a user picks a password, add a \"salt\" to it, and then apply a cryptographic hashing algorithm.\n",
    "3. Store the salt & hashed password along with your immutable user key (not necessarily username) as your password database. Forget the clear text password as soon as possible.\n",
    "4. When user logs in (sending the clear text password) apply the same algorithm as in step 2 and then compare the results.\n",
    "5. Regardless, secure your database and only grant access on a need to know basis.\n",

    "In terms of password strength\n",
    "\n",
    "All this is complicated, both for you and the user, and it would often be easier to make it someone else's problem. Single Sign On (SSO) makes this possible by redirecting authentication requests to a single large provider, who then responds with short lived \"tokens\" which assert the user's identity to the third party website. The full path of communication is shown in the image below.\n",

    "The UK and the EU countries have all passed similar data protection law, normally called the General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)) which protects the personal data of those living in the European Economic Area. The law allows individuals to access and correct their identifiable personal data when stored in easily searchable forms such as on computer. It also places constraints on the forms this information should be stored in, whether they can transfer outside the EEA and the rules over who can access them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also computational science is less affected than, for example, medicine, it is still possible that they (or their successor regulations) will one day apply to you. Although the core Articles are relatively complex they boil down to the idea that identifable personal information (individual records linked names, addresses, phone numbers etc, or to personal descriptions) should only be kept for as long as strictly necessary, and only be accessible by those that need to access it for the reason it was originally collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individuals have the right to request a copy of the records held on them by companies (or other bodies engaged in \"economic activity\"), and to correct any wrong information which is being stored. \n",

    "### Azure Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "[Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/introducing-azure-functions/) is a service which allows a Python function to be accessed directly from the web via parameters passed through a URL. An example will be shown in the lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure has several systems available to store data, depending on its format. This might be unstructured binary data, structured databases or something in between\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blob Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "To quote Microsoft, [blob storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction) is designed to hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Serving images or documents directly to a browser.\n",
    "> - Storing files for distributed access.\n",
    "> - Streaming video and audio.\n",
    "> - Writing to log files.\n",
    "> - Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.\n",
    "> - Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is accessed via a network interface, with charges depending on how frequent access is expected to be and the volume of data transferred. In general a URL is assigned to each item, which can be used in multiple ways, including those listed above, to access the blob object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure provides a number of ways to access data in databases. Most of them are built around the [SQL database language](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/sql-commands). SQL, which dates back to 1974, follows a hierarchical approach, with a database server holding databases, each of which can hold multiple tables holding records each of which has multiple values in multiple columns. A useful mental reference is to multiple spreadsheet files (e.g. Excel) each containing multiple sheets with rows with data in multiple columns. However as so often with scriptable text interfaces, access is more powerful, although difficult for newcomers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with inbuilt support for SQL in SQLite format, in which individual databases are stored in local files, via the builtin package `sqlite3`. To use a full fat SQL server on Azure appropriate additional software should be downloaded [e.g the MySql connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/connect-python). However the basic syntax to connect to, read and update individual databases remains similar."
