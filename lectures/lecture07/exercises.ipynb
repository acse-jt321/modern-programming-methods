    "#### Exercise : VMs\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is based on the [worked example](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-900T0x-MicrosoftAzureFundamentals/Instructions/Walkthroughs/01-Create%20a%20virtual%20machine.html) presented on the Azure GitHub pages for AZ900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification. In that example it walks through setting up a Windows server VM. Here we'll set up a linux machine instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)\n",
    "2. From the **All services** blade search for and select **Virtual machines** and then click **+ Add** and chose **+ Virtual machine**\n",
    "3. On the **Basics** tab change the following from the default values:\n",
    "    - Change *Subscription* to *Azure for Students*.\n",
    "    - Select *create new*  for **Resource group** and give a name you'll remember.\n",
    "    - Set **Virtual machine name** as *myVm.\n",
    "    - Choose **Image** as *Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS - Gen1*.\n",
    "    - Open **Inbound port** for *HTTP(80)* as well as *SSH(22).\n",
    "    - Select password authentication and pick a username & password.\n",
    "4. Now click `create`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any unacceptable values or warnings are highlighted. Note that some security settings are not recommended for long term unattended systems (e.g. password based SSH).\n",
    "    \n",
    "When the machine is fully created, click the pop-up \"Go to resource\" button and note down the ip address you have been issued. You may now connect to the remote Ubuntu linux server using a command like\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ssh mycoolusername@123.456.78.123\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have to type `y` to accept a new hash key before connecting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are connected, lets do something easy and open up a simple text editor by entering\n",
    "`nano`. Type a simple message and save it to disk using the command `ctrl+o`. Finally exit using `ctrl+x`. If you forget key commands, the bar at the bottom will remind you, as long as you remember that `^` means `ctrl+`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we opened the HTTP port, we can serve this file to the world using the python command\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo python3 -m http.server 80\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as you saw on Monday If you type the IP address you were given into your browser address bar, you will now see your message. Note that we had to use `python3` since on this machine `python` would get you python2.7. Type `ctrl+c` when you wish to stop serving the web page and get back to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can install system packages by combining the `sudo` and `apt` commands. For example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt update\n",
    "sudo apt install python3-pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will install a python3 version of pip as `pip3`. You will note that some other system packages need updating. With IaaS such as virtual machines, this is your job.\n",
    "\n",
    "When pip3 is installed, then running \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "export PATH=./local/bin:$PATH\n",
    "sudo apt install npm\n",
    "sudo npm install -g configurable-http-proxy\n",
    "sudo python3 -m pip install jupyter-core\n",
    "sudo python3 -m pip install jupyterhub\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will install a version of jupyter. Running it with\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo python3 -m jupyterhub --port 80`\n",
    "\n",
    "will present a login page at the ip address, to which you can authenticate with the login and password you used to connect to the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are finished with the machine, go back to the portal, access the resource group you created and delete it to avoid running up any more cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Azure version of this walkthrough shows how to connect to a Windows image using RDP. Feel free to try that as well. **Remember to clean up by deleting your resource groups at the end of the session!**\n",
